Book_Search_Engine
==================

A book search engine based on Nodejs and Express framework. You can search your favourite book and see what is the price of it on various merchant websites.

This search engine can save your time and sometimes it will not function because of isbn server(They have a problem of handling multiple request at the same time). But Don't loose hope try it again.

To run this:-

. clone this project

. install nodejs and express globally or you can go in the directory of   the installed project and type npm install

. then after installation of all the packages just type "node app". It will run in localhost.

This is a nice code from which you can learn the integration of awesome express framework with node and the request response chain in nodejs. Soon I will upload it on nodester... :)

See a demo of this on http://book_search.aws.af.cm

Feel free to use it and Keep on coding .. :)
